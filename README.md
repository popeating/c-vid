# c-vid
C-Vid is a basic app (at the moment just a skeleton) that show data about Covid-19 in italy, it elaborate data coming from official source of "Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri - Dipartimento della Protezione Civile
"

The app is made with Expo, since at the moment i don't need any fancy functionality that Expo do not support.

At the moment the only dependency is AsyncStorage, used to save incremental data and show it in case the phone is offline
